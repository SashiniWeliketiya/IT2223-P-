// 🔍 **Binary Search**

✅ Target found at index: `6`  
⏱️ Elapsed Time: `0.001245 seconds`

// 🔎 **Linear Search**

✅ The target element is found at index: `6`  
⏱️ Elapsed Time: `0.000507 seconds`

## ⚖️ **Comparison Result**

📌 **According to the result, linear search is faster than binary search.**

### 📈 Performance Notes:

- ⚠️ *For small datasets*, **linear search** might surprisingly be faster, even though it has a worse theoretical complexity **(O(n))**.
- 🚀 *For large or frequently searched sorted data*, **binary search** is the better long-term choice due to its logarithmic efficiency **(O(log n))**.
