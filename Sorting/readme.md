### 2.Bubblesort


💡 How Bubble Sort Works:


1.First pass: Goes through the array and "bubbles up" the largest number to the end 🫧.

2.Second pass: Does the same for the next largest number, now ignoring the last sorted one.

3.Repeats until all numbers are sorted 🔄✅.


Example:-


Pass 1: Largest (90) moves to the end.

Pass 2: Next largest (64) moves to second last.

...

Continues until the entire list is sorted.

### 3.Insertionsort


💡 How Insertion Sort Works:


🧠 Insertion Sort works just like sorting playing cards in your hands:

1.Start with the second card 🎴.

2.Compare it with the cards before it.

3.Insert it in the correct place.

4.Repeat for all cards until the hand is sorted ♠️♥️♣️♦️.
