### 1.Bubblesort


ðŸ’¡ How Bubble Sort Works:


1.First pass: Goes through the array and "bubbles up" the largest number to the end ðŸ«§.

2.Second pass: Does the same for the next largest number, now ignoring the last sorted one.

3.Repeats until all numbers are sorted ðŸ”„âœ….


Example:-


Pass 1: Largest (90) moves to the end.

Pass 2: Next largest (64) moves to second last.

...

Continues until the entire list is sorted.
