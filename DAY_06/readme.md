// binarysearch
Target found at index: 6

Elapsed Time for binary search:0.001245seconds

// linearsearch
The target element is found at index:  6

Elapsed Time for linear search:0.000507seconds

According to the result,,linear search is faster than binary search

*For small datasets, linear search might surprisingly be faster, even though it has a worse theoretical complexity.

*For large or frequently searched sorted data, binary search is the better long-term choice due to its logarithmic efficiency.
